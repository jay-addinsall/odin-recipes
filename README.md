### The Odin Project #1 - Recipe Website

This is a project from The Odin Project HTML/CSS course. In this project, I will need to use HTML to build a basic reipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
This project will assist me in getting used to writing HTML, as well as get into the habit of commiting my changes using Git.
During the CSS course, we will come back to this project to add CSS and make it look pretty :)
