    <p>
        Almonds in a Haystack. At first glance you see almonds covering a white substance. I assumed it was Cool Whip <br> …almonds, sweetness, this can’t be bad. Then I realized it was Miracle Whip. Not even real mayonnaise. And <br> what was that bulk of stuff in the middle? It’s hard to read, but I have deduced what that all actually says:
